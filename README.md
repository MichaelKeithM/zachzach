#Zach Zach Number Cruncher

What is a Zach Zach? He is my middle son, the oldest of my twin sons. A quick history: I have three sons and my oldest, Caleb, was two years old when we brought Zachary home from the hospital. Caleb was just learning to talk and for some reason couldn't or wouldn't say, "Zachary" or "Zach" but for some reason would say "Zach Zach." The name stuck (along with a few affectionate others, as well) and nearly 10 years later, our Zachary is still Zach Zach. 

This is a special app for me for a few reasons:

1. This is my first app
2. It worked

I was just learning (and still am learning) JavaScript when I made this. The idea came to make this when Zach Zach noticed: 

**36 + 5 = 41** and **3 + 6 + 5 = 14**

Basically, I wanted a way to see if this was a pattern that occurred in other situations where a 2-digit number was added to a single-digit number. This code is crude and it doesn't have much in the way of functionality. I have several ideas that I would like to incorporate into it and someday I might maybe hopefully make those improvements...
